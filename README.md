# Project Structure #

The project compromises three main classes: 'Board', 'Game' and 'Player'. Additionally there are test classes for the individual classes.
The 'Board' class represents the game board and provides methods for placing game pieces, checking game states, and displaying the current game board.
The 'Game' class controls the flow of the game, facilitates interaction with the user, and implements the game logic. It includes functions for playing against a human player or the computer.
The 'Player' class represents a player with a specific symbol ('X' or 'O'). The class offers methods for retrieving the player's symbol.
The 'Main' class contains the main method and serves as the entry point for the game.


# Starting the Application #

1. Execute the 'Main' class.
2. The game will start and provide instructions for selecting gamemode (against the computer or another player).

# Unit Tests #

Each class in the project is accompanied by a dedicated test class to ensure the correctness of its functionality.
